# Privacy Kit

A standardized toolkit that provides developers with ready-to-use cryptographic implementations for common privacy challenges in modern applications.

## What is Privacy Kit?

Privacy Kit offers cryptographic primitives and patterns that simplify implementing privacy features in applications. Similar to how JWT standardized authentication tokens and NaCl streamlined cryptography, Privacy Kit makes privacy implementation accessible without requiring deep cryptographic expertise.

## Features

* **Encryption Utilities**: Simple APIs for encrypting user data at rest and in transit
* **End-to-End Encryption**: Tools for secure communication between users
* **Secure Multi-Party Computation**: Methods for computing on encrypted data
* **Key Management**: Practical approaches to key generation, storage, and rotation
* **Cross-Platform Support**: Consistent implementations across languages and frameworks

## Core Goals

1. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Provide identical implementations across multiple languages and environments (iOS, Android, React Native, browsers, Node.js, Go, Rust, Python) ensuring the same security guarantees everywhere
2. **Simplify Implementation**: Provide clear APIs for common privacy patterns
3. **Reduce Errors**: Minimize the risk of cryptographic implementation mistakes
4. **Enable Privacy by Default**: Make it as easy to build private features as public ones

## Installation

```bash
npm install privacy-kit
yarn add privacy-kit
```
